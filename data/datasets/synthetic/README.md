# Neat data
Here we have data sets anomaly free. They are nice and neat.

## Subfolders
Data are divided into two folders:
- synthetic - This folder comprises synthetically created data sets. Examples: sine, a spike train or a constant function
- realWorld - The folder is empty for now. However, it is intended to contain real world unanomalied data (or cleaned data)
