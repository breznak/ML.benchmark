# Datasets (This section is work in progress.)

## Anomalies datasets

There are several types of anomalies in data streams. We categorize them in the following way:
- neatData – clean datasets generated with no anomalies included. Eg. sinus, constant, spike train.
- corruptedData – these datasets has been taken from the previous group but then corrupted by deterministic anomalies. Subfolders comprise datasets grouped by the category. Such as: point anomaly, modulation anomaly, shift anomaly, etc. 
		
Each of these folders contain source data and results generated in our experiment.

## Datasets structure

Neat data are cvs files with columns: time, function, period, anomaly.
- time – time in seconds
- function – an output of the given function f(t)
- period – integer addressing in which phase the given periodic fiction is. For instance, sinus with omega = 2 * pi rad/s and sampling frequency fs = 10 Hz is sampled in 10 samples in each period, therefore 'period' column would include numbers from 1 to 10, following the phase of sinus. 
- anomaly – boolean, if i-th sample contains anomaly, 'anomaly at i-th row' = 1, otherwise 0.

Results are cvs files as well. They contain additional columns: anomaly_score, anomaly_likelihood.
- anomaly_score – raw anomaly score generated by HTM core
- anomaly_likelihood – likelihood generated by HTM core
