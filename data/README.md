# Datasets (This section is work in progress.)

## Anomalies datasets

There are several types of anomalies in data streams. We categorize them in the following way:
- neatData – clean data sets generated with no anomalies included. Eg. sine, constant, spike train.
- corruptedData – these data sets has been taken from the previous group but then corrupted by deterministic anomalies. Subfolders comprise datasets grouped by the category. Such as: point anomaly, section anomaly, etc. 
		
Each of these folders contain source data and results generated in a HTM experiment.

## Data sets structure

Data are stored in cvs files with columns: time_stamp, function, phase, has_anomaly.
- time – time in seconds
- function – an output of the given function f(t)
- phase – a real number addressing in which phase the given periodic function is. For instance, 'phase' column would include numbers from 0 to 2*pi, following the phase of sinus. 
- has_anomaly – boolean, if i-th sample contains anomaly, 'anomaly at i-th row' = 1, otherwise 0.

Results are cvs files as well. They contain additional columns: anomaly_score, anomaly_likelihood.
- anomaly_score – raw anomaly score generated by HTM core
- anomaly_likelihood – likelihood generated by HTM core

## Why we use a strange f = 1.001 Hz?

We use data that are generated by a single frequency function, eg. 1 Hz sine or a spike train. The frequency of the function is f. Then, we sample the continuous function with the sampling frequency fs. Having considered the sampling theorem, we get a ratio K = fs/f > 2. If the ratio K is a natural number, what we get is a sequence of K numbers which are repeated exactly the same over and over again. 

The algorithm then does not create a model of the input data (sine function eg.), but it creates a model of a numbers series. That is a different task and, in fact, immensely easier. If we ensure an ugly real number, then there is a great chance we do not have any numbers series in the data. As a result, the algorithm really develops the model of the function.
