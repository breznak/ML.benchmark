Machine Learming benchmarks
=============

This repository should be a collection of 
* datasets
 * real-world
 * synthetic
* papers
* algorithm implementations
 * (initially) focus on HTM from [NuPIC](https://github.com/numenta/nupic), gladly include any other algorithms/results. 
* results
 * as CSV, image, ...

Aiming to throuroughly benchmark and compare the algorithms, for users being able to decide where each algorithm has its strong/weak-spots. 

This can also work as a benchmark to improve development of the algorithms.
